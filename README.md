# Train_the_trainers 2025 - CrickPartnership-DAIM
The Royal Microscopical Society section Data Analysis in IMaging (RMS DAIM), with the support of the Crick and Partners Networking Fund, is organising a “Train the Trainers in Bioimage Analysis” workshop.

The Train the Trainers initiative aims to establish and disseminate guidelines on how to organise courses and train researchers in bioimage analysis. Attendees of the Train the Trainer session will become part of a network that provides local expertise and creates efficient channels for the dissemination of knowledge and good practices in bioimage analysis.

The event is free, and travel and accommodation support will be available for attendees outside the London area (max £100 pp).

Participants will be selected based on their expertise and role as trainers in bioimaging facilities or research groups. The target audience includes researchers with knowledge of bioimage analysis principles who wish to improve their skills in providing training.
